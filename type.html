<h3 class="th3">Galaxies</h3>
<p>Early in this century, there was a great debate as to the nature of the nebulae 
like this one which at that time could not be resolved into individual stars.
 Thanks in large part to the work of Edwin Hubble whose famous paper "The Realm of the Nebulae" 
 finally put the issue to rest, we now know that these are really vast conglomerates billions of
 stars which are very much more distant from the Earth than other nebulae. 
Our own Milky Way galaxy is just one of the billions of galaxies now known to exist.
 A typical galaxy is 100,000 light-years in diameter.</p>

<h3 class="th3">Globular Clusters</h3>
<p>Globular clusters are gravitationally bound groups of many thousands (sometimes as many as a million) of stars. 
They consist primarily of very old stars. Globular clusters are not concentrated in the plane of the galaxy but 
rather are randomly distributed throughout the halo. 
There are several hundred globular clusters associated with our galaxy. A typical globular cluster is a few hundred light-years across.</p>

<h3 class="th3">Open Clusters</h3>
<p>Open clusters are loose aggregations of dozens or hundreds of young stars. They are generally not gravitationally bound and will disperse in a relatively short period of time, astronomically speaking. They are often associated with more diffuse nebulosity, as well. 
Also called "galactic clusters" because they are usually found in the plane of the galaxy. A typical open cluster is less than 50 light-years across.hey are generally not gravitationally bound and will disperse in a relatively short period of time, astronomically speaking. </p>

<h3 class="th3">Emission Nebulae</h3>
<p>Emission nebulae are clouds of high temperature gas. Among the several different types of emission nebulae are H II regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons; 
and planetary nebulae, in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers.The first person to recognize and discover a nebula in the true sense of a gaseous cloud was Nicholas de Peiresc, who saw the Orion nebula in 1610. It is notable that it is also the first deep sky object ever discovered with a telescope, though Galileo did note that the Beehive cluster</p>

<h3 class="th3">Reflection Nebulae</h3>
<p>Reflection nebulae are clouds of dust which are simply reflecting the light of a nearby star or stars. Reflection nebulae are also usually sites of star formation. They are usually blue because the scattering is more efficient for blue light.
 Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are often seen together and are sometimes both referred to as diffuse nebulae.In essence, a nebula is formed when portions of the interstellar medium undergo gravitational collapse. Mutual gravitational attraction causes matter to clump together, forming regions of greater and greater density. </p>

<h3 class="th3">Dark Nebulae</h3>
<p>Dark nebulae are clouds of dust which are simply blocking the light from whatever is behind. They are physically very similar to reflection nebulae; they look different only because of the geometry of the light source, the cloud and the Earth. 
Dark nebulae are also often seen in conjunction with reflection and emission nebulae. A typical diffuse nebula is a few hundred light-years across.</p>

<h3 class="th3">Planetary Nebulae</h3>
<p>Planetary nebulae are shells of gas thrown out by some stars near the end of their lives. Our Sun will probably produce a planetary nebula in about 5 billion years. They have nothing at all to do with planets; the terminology was invented because they often look a little like planets in small telescopes.
 A typical planetary nebula is less than one light-year across.</p>

<h3 class="th3">Supernova Remnants</h3>
<p>Supernovae occur when a massive star ends its life in an amazing blaze of glory. For a few days a supernova emits as much energy as a whole galaxy.
 When it's all over, a large fraction of the star is blown into space as a supernova remnant. A typical supernova remnant is at most few light-years across.Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created in an Earthen environment. 


Most nebulae are vast in size, measuring up to hundreds of light years in diameter.  </p>

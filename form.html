<h3 class="fh3">Interstellar undergo</h3>
<p class="fp">In essence, a nebula is formed when portions of the interstellar medium undergo gravitational collapse. 
Mutual gravitational attraction causes matter to clump together, forming regions of greater and greater density.
 From this, stars may form in the center of the collapsing material, who’s ultraviolet ionizing radiation causes the surrounding gas to become visible at optical wavelengths.
</p>

<h3 class="fh3">Dense object</h3>
<p class="fp">Most nebulae are vast in size, measuring up to hundreds of light years in diameter.
 Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created in an Earthen environment. 
 In fact, a nebular cloud that was similar in size to Earth would only so much material that its mass would be only a few kilograms.</p>

<h3 class="fh3">Other circumstances</h3>
<p class="fp">Other nebulae form as the result of supernova explosions; the death throes of massive, short-lived stars.
 The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are then ionized by the energy and the compact object that its core produces. 
One of the best examples of this is the Crab Nebula, in Taurus.</p>

<h3 class="fh3">Planetary options</h3>
<p class="fp">Still other nebulae form as planetary nebulae. This is the final stage of a low-mass star's life, like Earth's Sun. Stars with a mass up to 8–10 solar masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer layers during pulsations in their atmospheres. </p>

<h3 class="fh3">More than nebulae </h3>
<p class="fp">Less than 100 years ago people believed that our galaxy was the whole universe, and before the 1920s astronomers used to believe that the galaxies (other than our own) that they observed through their telescopes were actually local nebulae within our own Milky Way Galaxy. They subsequently called them “spiral nebulae”.</p>
